The process of finding key players in a network using FINDER. The network used here is the same as that in Figure 1, i.e., the 9/11 terrorist network.

code: Figure 2.ipynb
data: Krebs.txt, the 9/11 terrorist network, which contains 62 nodes and 159 edges.
result: including CN and ND subfolders, which stores each network state at each time snapshot. Note that we only show snapshot 3, 9 and 16 for illustration purpose in Figure 2.
